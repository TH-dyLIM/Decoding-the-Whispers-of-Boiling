## Research Highlights
- **Nonintrusive acoustic-based monitoring:** Our approach uses external acoustic signals, eliminating the need for direct visualization or intrusive sensors. This enables accurate boiling diagnostics even in harsh, nontransparent, and radiation-intensive environments.
- **Advanced deep learning frameworks:** By employing state-of-the-art models—including transformers and Fourier neural operators—on spectrogram-derived features, we achieve high predictive accuracy and robustness against noise, ensuring reliable inference of heat flux, heat transfer coefficient, and boiling regime.
- **Broad applicability and industrial impact:** The proposed method not only delivers ±20% accuracy for critical boiling parameters and ~98% classification accuracy but also generalizes well to flow boiling scenarios. Its successful application across varying conditions can enhance safety margins, operational efficiency, and real-time control in diverse thermal energy systems.
